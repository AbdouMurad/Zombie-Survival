Zombie Survival

The game is designed to see how many rounds of zombies the player can last with increasing amounts of zombies who have improved health and speed as the game progresses. Eliminate zombies to earn cash that can be used to purchase weapons. 
The map is designed using a unique method where a PNG image is transformed into the map. Every pixel in the image is processed and depending on the red value of the color, a corresponding tile is placed. This allowed for a very quick map design which can easily be adjusted and improved/
